# JOak Umbrella
An umbrella project for easily compiling all my projects related to creating, reading and running JVM .class files.

It includes:

* [JOak JVM](https://github.com/programmatix/JOakJVM): a basic, but functioning, JVM written in Scala.
* [JOak Analyser](https://github.com/programmatix/JOakAnalyser): a command-line tool for debugging & analysing JVM .class files.
* [JOak ClassFiles](https://github.com/programmatix/JOakClassFiles): a JVM micro-library for reading JVM .class files.

## Use
Clone this project, then run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
See the individual projects for usage instructions.  This project simply makes sure that all dependencies are where they're expected to be.
