# JVM
An umbrella project for easily compiling all my projects related to creating, reading and running JVM .class files.

It includes:

* [JVM](https://github.com/programmatix/JVM): a basic, but functioning, JVM written in Scala.
* [javap](https://github.com/programmatix/javap): a javap alternative/clone for debugging & analysing JVM .class files.
* [JVMClassFiles](https://github.com/programmatix/ClassFiles): a JVM library for reading JVM .class files.

## Use
Clone this project.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
See the individual projects for usage instructions.  This project simply makes sure that all dependencies are where they're expected to be.
